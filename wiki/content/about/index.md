# STE 332

STE 332 (Suite 332) is the workshop of The Prepared dot org. It is The Prepared's headquarters, assembly shop, workspace, and studio. There are workbenches and desks rented out monthly. 

## Workshop rules
This is a shared space. Treat it as you would your home. Clean up after yourself, take out the trash, and don't leave shared spaces (tables, kitchen, sink) cluttered or dirty when you leave. 

## Trash and other waste
There are 3 trash bins by the kitchen. 

Blue = cans and plastics
Green = paper
Grey = trash

544 Park Ave (the building) does not recycle cans and plastics. We take these to a near by facility or to one of our respective homes on pick up day.

## Tools (shared and non shared)

Most tools are not shared. Anything not explicitly labeled as "Shared" (maybe common?) should not be used without first checking with the owner. 

Some tools are shared. If you don't know how to use one of the shared tools just ask. We'll help you. These shared tools are listed below:
